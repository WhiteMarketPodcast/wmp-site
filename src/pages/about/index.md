**White Market Podcast** is an award-winning\* show about **free music** and **free culture** by Rute Correia. While the show is mainly focused on **Creative Commons**-licensed music, since it is also naturally intertwined with other movements and ideologies such as **open source** and **open access**, it often features these and similar **forms of activism related to digital rights and freedoms**.

Our promise to deliver netaudio music and raise free culture awareness is also stated on [our collection on **Free Music Archive**](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/programamarcabranca/).

**White Market Podcast** is a completely **independent, non-profit and volunteer-based project**.

White Market Podcast is the English-spoken successor or Programa Marca Branca. Between 2008 and 2013, Programa Marca Branca was the only regular Portuguese radio show exclusively dedicated to netaudio and free culture, with weekly podcasts and features about this digital universe. The show was broadcast on five different radio stations in Portugal and Spain. The project had to go on hold at the end of 2013.
