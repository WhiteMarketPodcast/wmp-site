After months of silence, White Market is back on this glorious web adress. While our old website sadly died, our old podcasts remain available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22White+Market+Podcast%22) and [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/whitemarketpodcast). On Sunday, I’ll be live on [Spark Sunderland](http://www.sparksunderland.com/) from 8pm bringing you some more Creative Commons-licenced songs and other free tunes.

As a celebration, I took this opportunity to upload one of my favourite netaudio records into Free Music Archive: [Kersche Remixed](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Norton/Kersche_Remixed/) by [Norton](https://www.facebook.com/wearenorton). Published in 2008 by now extinct aerotone, the album is a collection of remixes from their second record, Kersche. With a [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) tag on it, you’re free to do loads of things with this, so long as you do it for non-commercial purposes and you share your work under the same licence. For now, you can start by listening to it and download it legally and for free.
