After two very [special](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/podcasts/2016/09/25/session-3-10-need-free-music-archive/) [episodes](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/podcasts/2016/10/02/session-3-11-experimentalism-pilot-eleven/), today we go back to a full music session. We have bedroom pop and undiscovered netlabels, as well as some older loves.

As my [dissertation is coming to an end](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/blog/2016/07/06/white-market-becomes-syndication-platform/), I will continue to release new epiosdes of White Market Podcast on a weekly basis. I have a few interviews and features planned, and I still have a [White Market in Context](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/blog/2016/09/27/white-market-context-i-production-effort-production-values/) I’d like to share about the show in relation to its community. For now, I would like to express my tremendous gratitude towards all the interviewees in this season (so far), to [**Soundart Radio**](http://soundartradio.org.uk/) and Diane Gray for their immense help with the radio broadcast side of it, and, of course, to all the artists and labels that keep releasing their music under **Creative Commons**.
