White Market joined the celebrations of [**International Women’s Day**](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/) on **[Spark Sunderland](http://sparksunderland.com/)** with a live full hour of free music by female artists. On top of that we gathered the voices of some inspirational women that are actively involved in open content, digital freedom and activism. The show included messages from **[MEP Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/en/)**, who is behind the current revision of the copyright legislation in the EU; **[Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/)** director, Cheyenne Hohmann; and **[Jen Wike Huger](https://twitter.com/jenwike)**, content manager at **[OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/).**

Playlist will be updated soon! In the meantime, you can listen again here.
