When we pay taxes, a lot of things happen to that money. It funds education, health care and, among many other things, software development. As societies cement their structures on digital systems, software becomes a huge part of our lives whether we want to or not. White Market Podcast is supporting [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) and 30 other organizations on the “[**Public Money? Public Code!**](https://publiccode.eu/)” campaign. We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a free and open source software licence.

[![public money public code](https://fsfe.org/contribute/promopics/pmpc-sticker-thumb.png)](https://publiccode.eu/)Free software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy. Keeping software locked prevents citizens from knowing how their sensitive data is used, for instance. It also wastes money and public resources, as software cannot be used across sectors and activities. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.
