White Market Podcast strives to be an accessible project, so I have been making the show available in a variety of platforms. You can download and listen each episode straight from this website and from [**Archive.org**](https://archive.org/details/@white_market_podcast), you can subscribe to the podcast via **[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/white-market-podcast/id1033024096)** and via [**RSS feed**](/rss.xml/) and you can now listen to all of season 3 episodes on **[Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/whitemarketpodcast/)**. For those of you who are not familiar with it, Mixcloud is a streaming platform focused on radio content and dj mixes. You can think of it a Soundcloud dedicated longer audio formats. While season 4 is cooking up, why not listen to some of our old shows there?

## Did I just read “season 4”?

Yes, season 4 of White Market Podcast is cooking up! Episode 1 is surely one not to be missed, especially if you’re into copyright. As the **copyright reform in the EU** takes [dangerous turns](https://juliareda.eu/2017/07/a-loss-for-culture-and-research/), I talked to [Diego Naranjo](https://twitter.com/DNBSevilla) from **[EDRi](https://edri.org)** to find out what the implications of these new paths are, how EDRi works and and how [there’s still time to help **change things**](https://savethememe.net/en) and save the internet as we know it. EDRi is short for European Digital Rights and it is an association of civil and human rights organisations from across Europe defending rights and freedoms in the digital environment. As usual, the episode will be sprinkled with some awesome Creative Commons-licensed music. To make sure you don’t miss out on the upcoming show, just use one of the links above to follow WMP.
