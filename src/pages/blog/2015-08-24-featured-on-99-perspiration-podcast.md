Great news here! I’ve been featured on the latest session of [99% Perspiration](http://99podcast.com/2015/08/21/episode-18-never-stop/) podcast. Produced and conducted by [Jay Sykes](https://www.facebook.com/jaysykesmedia), it is a wonderful podcast about the arts world, with interviews and advice on how to get in the business from people already in the business with the most varied backgrounds. During the interview, I talked about White Market podcast, and about my other lifetime project, [Rute’s Loot](http://www.rutesloot.co.uk/), giving my own insight of the creative business and even sharing some advice for newcomers.

This session also includes statements from [Stephen Pritchard](https://twitter.com/etiennelefleur), a PhD researcher in socially engaged and participatory arts.
