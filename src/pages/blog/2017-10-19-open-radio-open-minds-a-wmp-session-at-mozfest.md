If you’re gonna be at MozFest, make sure to come by and say hi. I’d love to meet you and talk about all things open.

## Open Radio, Open Minds

**What is it about?**  
The session is about making open radio content. Think podcasts, think online and community radio stations, think radio journalism and advocacy.

**What’s gonna happen?**  
I will go over the basics of sound recording and editing. I will show you some examples of good practices for community work in this context, which should include the very own White Market Podcast. If we manage to finish some features, these will be show cased on Sunday.

**Is this session for me?**  
Probably, if you’re:

- ​a content producer with interest in radio and podcasting (or want to become one)
- ​someone with interest in community radio and community media projects

Not quite, if you:

- ​have advanced knowledge of radio content production and audio editing

**What do I need to take part in this session?**

- One laptop per person/team (people can work individually or in groups)
- Recommended software (it’s FLOSS!): [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) and [Ardour](http://ardour.org/)
- You are encouraged to bring in phones and other portable audio recording equipment you might have
