Back in August, I had the chance of talking to **Dimitar Dimitrov**, EU Policy Director at [**Wikimedia**](https://www.wikimedia.org/). On their website, **Wikimedia** is described as a global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world. By now, it is one of the top 10 websites traffic-wise globally and it is arguably the biggest community-driven project online. It all started with the amazing [**Wikipedia**](https://www.wikipedia.org/), but as knowledge kept getting compiled, their projects also kept on multiplying. Today, the **Wikimedia Foundation** hosts a dozen projects with the joint goal of sharing knowledge – [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/), [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and their latest baby [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) are just a few of them.

Being a content superpower is not easy, though. Surely a hot topic at the minute, the upcoming EU copyright reform is something under their radar but this legislation is far from being the only thing with a deep impact on Wikimedia’s work. For a long time now, they have been facing a variety of challenges that go from censorship in certain countries to court rulings that place double-standards in terms of what people can do with content online and offline. To find out more about these things and, of course, how you can get involved with Wikimedia, just press play.
