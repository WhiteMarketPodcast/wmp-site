Remember how a few months ago we all talked about **[Freedom of Panorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama)**? And how the very essence of the internet is at stake in some territories and we’re trying to [**#SaveTheLink**](https://savethelink.org/)?

Well, the European Commission is now holding a [**public consultation** on neighbouring rights and panorama exception in the EU copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-seeks-views-neighbouring-rights-and-panorama-exception-eu-copyright).

Complicated much? Not really. Basically, you’ll have your say on **your right to take pictures to works of art in public places**, such as the Eiffel Tower, London Eye or Edinburgh’s Castle.

As for the neighbouring rights, these are extra rights for publishers over published works. As MEP Julia Reda [explains](https://juliareda.eu/2016/03/copyright-consultation/) in her blog, “a*fter attempts at forcing Google News to pay newspapers for linking to their websites backfired in Germany and Spain, publishers have doubled down: The idea of an “ancillary copyright” is back in a broader and badder version. Should publishers get extra control over how content is linked to and displayed on the web?”*

The consultation is part of the current **EU strategy for a Digital Single Market** and it is now open to every sectors of society. You have until **June 11th** to fill it and **share it**.
