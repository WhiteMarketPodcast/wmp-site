In the past few years, there has been a lot of work put into trying to make the show available in as many places as possible. Now, we found our own spot at one of the world's largest audio streaming platforms.

You can now **[follow White Market Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4o2iPfNaRrP73gWsmQ7yF3?si=CoK9hmBnQHSb1MQVuluNcQ)**.

If you're not a Spotify fan/user, you can also find us in a variety of other platforms, such as [iTunes/Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/white-market-podcast/id1033024096), [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2hpdGVtYXJrZXRwb2RjYXN0LmV1L3Jzcy54bWw%3D) and [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/whitemarketpodcast/). Podcast fans that prefer a more open distribution mode can always use our [RSS feed](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/rss.xml) on any podcatcher of their choice. 

We use [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@white_market_podcast) as our host provider and as a permanent archive of the audio content produced. 
On top of the episodes, you can also find separate content there, like stand-alone interviews and special features so that whoever wants to use those bits can do it so in an easy manner. For separate and special content, we try to provide high-quality versions of the audio in FLAC files (like in our "[Linux 25 - The Story of Linux](https://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/blog/2016-08-25-linux-25-story-linux/)" short documentary).
