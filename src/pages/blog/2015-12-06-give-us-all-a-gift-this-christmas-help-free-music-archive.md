For the first time ever, **[Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/)** is having a fund raising! Not only is that quite exciting, as it’d be a great Christmas gift for all of us, free music enthusiasts. Also, if you’re a big spender you can grab the first official FMA t-shirt ever made (_whaaaaaat_). So, yeah, go get your goodies and help Free Music Archive to stay alive and healthy.

If you want to find out a bit more how awesome and great the project is, you can **[listen to the interview](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/podcasts/2015/09/06/session-2-10-all-hail-the-free-music-archive/)** I did with the Director of the FMA, Cheyenne Hohman, back in September.
