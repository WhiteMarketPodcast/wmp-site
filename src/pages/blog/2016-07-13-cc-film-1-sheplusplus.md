A couple of years ago, White Market started a feature called **CC Film Wednesday**, where we’d feature a Creative Commons film every week. Finally, we are now bringing it back. The first choice for the comeback of CC Film Wednesday on White Market is [**she++: The Documentary**](https://vimeo.com/63877454).

Available on Vimeo, under a [**Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial (CC BY-NC)**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) licence, the feature offers an insight on women in computer science. Directed by [Ellora Israni](https://vimeo.com/user17661297) and Ayna Agarwal, the film is part of the [**she++ initiative**](http://www.sheplusplus.com/) strategy to tackle the gender gap in computer science by “dismantling the negative stereotypes surrounding the industry”. While the film dates back to 2013, the project is still running and it has the support of Stanford University, as well as companies such as Microsoft and Google.
