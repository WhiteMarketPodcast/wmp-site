This **CC Film Wednesday**, we bring you [“**An Island**, a film with **Efterklang”**](http://anisland.cc/home). Directed by the French independent filmmaker **[Vincent Moon](http://www.vincentmoon.com/)**, the feature film is a documentary about the Danish band [Efterklang](http://efterklang.net/home/). The initial idea of the picture was to create some sort of setting in which live sessions and performances on film would match the length of an album. While this premise remained accurate in the final product (the film is nearly 50min long), the film stands out as much more than that. In fact, it is a wonderful work of art offering a unique view over the work and life of the band.

Vincent Moon’s work as a cinematographer revolves mostly around music. On top of his exciting short documentaries and videos on global sounds and folk music, he has also [released the audio tracks of these as actual records on Bandcamp](https://petitesplanetes.bandcamp.com/). The most exciting part? His work, including “An Island, a film with Efterklang”, is all published under a [**Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) licence. Enjoy!
