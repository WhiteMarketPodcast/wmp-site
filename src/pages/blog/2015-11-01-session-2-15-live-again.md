After a few weeks of pre-recorded sessions, we live again from Spark’s studio with a full hour of carefully selected free music. A bit more on edge than usual, I explored different sound landscapes in a set that had space for dubstep, improvised music, lo-fi folk, trip-hop and more. I visited some of my favourites, but also opened doors for some new music to walk in.
