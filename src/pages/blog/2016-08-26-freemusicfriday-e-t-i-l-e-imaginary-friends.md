Our [**#freemusicfriday**](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/freemusicfriday/) feature is back, which means every friday I’ll be uploading a new record to [**Free Music Archive**](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/programamarcabranca/). This week, I bring you one of my personal favourites. Originally released on the Argentinian netlabel **[Sólo Le Pido a Dior](https://sololepidoadior.bandcamp.com/album/spd-08-our-imaginary-friend)**, “**Our Imaginary Friend**” by **E T I L E** is a seven-track record and is available under a [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) licence, which allows you to freely download it and share it. All you have to do is to give the appropriate credit and to not use it for any commercial purposes.

Dreamy and pink, this album is a warm landscape of different electronic ambiences. Squashed between what are nearly opposite sounds, from downtempo to industrial, “**[Our Imaginary Friend](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/E_T_I_L_E/Our_Imaginary_Friend/)**” is beautiful and is waiting for you to [**download it**](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/E_T_I_L_E/Our_Imaginary_Friend/). For free, as usual.
