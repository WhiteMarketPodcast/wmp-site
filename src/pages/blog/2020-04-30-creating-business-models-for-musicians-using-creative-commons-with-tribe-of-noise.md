A first on the show, on this episode we dive into business models! Yes, you read it right: business models for music licensed under Creative Commons. For that, I talked to [Hessel van Oorschot](https://twitter.com/73553H), co-founder and CEO at [Tribe of Noise](https://www.tribeofnoise.com/), a platform focused on creating fair and sustainable business opportunities for independent musicians. 

They launched back in 2008 in the Netherlands. Now, they provide a steady revenue stream for hundreds of musicians around the world, exploring non-exclusive music licensing to third-parties like cinematographers, advertising agencies and retail spaces. Along with Amanda Palmer and Jonathan Mann, they were one of the few music-based case studies featured on the book "[Made With Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/made-with-cc.pdf)".

Back in September, Tribe of Noise acquired [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/). Make sure to subscribe to the podcast so you can find out more about it on the second part of this interview, when we release our next episode.
