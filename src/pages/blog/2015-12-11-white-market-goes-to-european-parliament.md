It’s been quite a year for White Market, but the goodies don’t seem to be stopping any time soon. I am actually writing this from Brussels, where I am attending a three day session hosted by MEP Julia Reda’s office. I am not by myself, as you may imagine: a few dozens of other people who have been working towards the building of a freer and more accessible digital society are also here. So far, there,  was a lot of talk about the [portability bill](http://www.europeanlawmonitor.org/latest-eu-news/commission-takes-first-steps-to-broaden-access-to-online-content-and-outlines-its-vision-to-modernise-eu-copyright-rules.html?q=portability), copyright in general and other related issues such as digital single market.

There will be longer and more detailed posts soon enough. But for now, all I can say is that it has been a great experience so far and that there will probably be quite a few interviews on the upcoming podcasts.
