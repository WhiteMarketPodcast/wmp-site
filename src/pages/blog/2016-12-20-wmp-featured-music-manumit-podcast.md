There are various podcasts about Creative Commons music. For those of you interested to know a bit more about specific projects, **[Music Manumit podcast](http://www.musicmanumit.com/)** is certainly one not to miss. Every week, they interview different players of the CC music scene. From [Jamendo](http://www.musicmanumit.com/2016/10/jamendo-2-161023-music-manumit-podcast.html) to musicians like [Electric Mirrors](http://www.musicmanumit.com/2016/10/electric-mirrors-161002-music-manumit.html), Doug and Tom have it all covered. So, I am quite honoured to say that White Market Podcast is featured on this week’s episode of Music Manumit podcast.

Tom and I talked about Creative Commons music, my professional background, how [WMP is a radio show that is also a podcast](/blog/2016-09-29-white-market-in-context-ii-a-podcast-for-radio/), why this season of WMP became the best so far, professional conflicts of interest and many other details.
