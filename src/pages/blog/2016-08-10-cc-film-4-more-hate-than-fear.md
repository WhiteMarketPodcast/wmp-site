This **CC Film Wednesday**, we travel all the way down to London to find out about graffiti and addiction. “**[More Hate Than Fear](https://vimeo.com/157336974)**” is a short documentary by [**Molly Manning Walker**](http://www.mollymanningwalker.com/). The documentary has inspired Molly to write a [fictional short with the same title](http://www.morehatethanfear.com/), which has made it into the official selection of various film festivals for this year. Beyond the array of nominations of the side film, “More Hate Than Fear Documentary” offers an incredible insight about the reality of  graffiti writers in London. More than finding how, the motion picture focuses on the “why” behind every tag, while showcasing the lives of grafitters and their families.
