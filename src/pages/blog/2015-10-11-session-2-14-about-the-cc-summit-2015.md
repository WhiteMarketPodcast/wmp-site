Today, we had a special session about the **[CC Summit 2015](https://summit.creativecommons.org/)**.

> The Global Summit brings together the community of experts, academics, and activists who comprise the Creative Commons affiliate network in a different country every two years.

<cite>CC Summit 2015 website</cite>

CC Summit 2015 will take place in Seoul next week, from 14th to 17th of October. It’s a once-in-every-two-years event that brings Creative Commons enthusiasts, advocates and users together to share experiences, challenges and expectations regarding CC licences and everything that can be related to them. On this show, I had the great pleasure of talking to Paul Stacey, Senior Project Manager at Creative Commons HQ team and one of the people behind the organisation of this year’s CC Summit. We talked about some of the programme highlights, some of the challenges Creative Commons have yet to tackle and we also took the opportunity to talk a bit about the [recently-funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/creativecommons/made-with-creative-commons-a-book-on-open-business) Kickstarter project of writing a book about Open Business models, in which Paul is also involved. During the rest of the show, we brought to daylight some of the best free music on the web, as usual. This time with a lot of new releases!
