After many technical difficulties, a lot of travelling and a week of unstoppable rain in the North East of England, the show is finally online. Being very honest, I would have liked it to have some extra content, but it was impossible after a series of unfortunate events. In a near future there’s still a European Commons Assembly special to come and a Europeana special as well!

For now, here’s this week’s free music mix for you.
