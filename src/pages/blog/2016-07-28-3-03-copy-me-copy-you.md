On this week’s show, we had the pleasure to talk to **Alex Lungu** from [**Copy-Me**](http://copy-me.org). **Copy-Me** is a platform that tries to debunk myths around copying… So, they talk a lot about issues such as copyright, remixing, creativity and so on. The project started as a [webseries](http://copy-me.org/category/web-series/) and [was crowdfunded on Indiegogo](http://copy-me.org/2014/04/copy-me-indiegogo-crowdfunded-web-series-on-copyright/). Now, **Copy-Me** is a hub of knowledge and creative resources related to said topics. Much like **White Market Podcast**, because copyright is such a complex issue, they often delve into parallel themes, such as piracy and web surveillance.

Following the current [transformation of White Market into a syndication platform](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/blog/2016/07/06/white-market-becomes-syndication-platform/) for community radio stations, [the interview is also available for download](https://archive.org/details/WMP_Interview_AlexLunguCopyMe) as a standalone piece (two parts), in both WAV and MP3. You can find extra details about the content on each part and extra credits [**here**](https://archive.org/details/WMP_Interview_AlexLunguCopyMe).
