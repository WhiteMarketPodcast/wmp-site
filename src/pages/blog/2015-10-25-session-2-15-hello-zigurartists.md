Releasing free music since 2012, **[ZigurArtists](http://zigurartists.com/)** is one of the top netlabels of its generation. With a varied catalogue and a steady love for Creative Commons licences, they managed to bring back to life a deeply aged Portuguese town called Lamego. Three years after their start, their work includes not only an incredible music collection but also a yearly music festival called [ZigurFest](http://zigurartists.com/). On this latest session, I talked to António Silva, one of ZigurArtists co-founders to understand how the collective started and what they aim for. From their [early feature in Monocle](https://www.facebook.com/MarcaBranca/photos/a.10151747096300173.862588.341762825172/10152146105115173/?type=3) to cassettes and talent scouting, there was time to talk about various bits and bobs and, of course, some great music from their catalogue.
