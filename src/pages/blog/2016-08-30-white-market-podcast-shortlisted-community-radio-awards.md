We proudly announce th**at White Market Podcast** is nominated for the “Innovation Award of the Year” category at the [**Community Radio Awards**](http://communityradioawards.co.uk/shortlist-revealed-for-the-community-radio-awards-2016/). White Market Podcast’s entry reflected its community-oriented ethos, as well as its commitment to digital rights and freedom. It focused on the work developed over 2015 and early 2016.

After [eight years of work and some changes in language and name](http://www.whitemarketpodcast.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/White-Market-Stats-Syndication-Web.pdf), it feels great to get some extra recognition. So, to all the netlabels and artists that were featured on the show, as well as special guests I had the pleasure to talk to over the years, I can only say Thank You.

The [Community Radio Awards ceremony](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/community-radio-awards-2016-tickets-27073997054) will be held on September 10th, at Birmingham University.
