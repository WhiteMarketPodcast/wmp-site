**White Market Podcast** was distinguished with the **Silver Innovation Award of the Year** at the [**Community Radio Awards 2016**](http://communityradioawards.co.uk/stations-and-volunteers-recognised-at-first-ever-community-radio-awards/). White Market Podcast’s entry highlighted its multiplatform work, as well as its community-focused ethos.

Personally, I would like to thank all the artists that keep publishing their music under Creative Commons licences, to all the guests that agreed to be interviewed for the show over the years and, of course, to those who keep listening to the show. On top of this, I would also like to thank [Lisa Twohig](https://twitter.com/LisaTwohig), who co-produced some of the sessions last year. It is only fair to say that this award was powered by the whole copyleft music community, and that without you all there wouldn’t be a White Market Podcast.

White Market Podcast’s silver award was one of the seven awards [**Spark FM**](http://www.sparksunderland.com/) took home last Saturday.
