I just created a Free Music Archive mix with **[21 songs for Sunderland City of Culture 2021](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/programamarcabranca/21_Songs_for_Sunderland_2021)**. In case you missed it, White Market Podcast is now settled in Sunderland, in the North East of England. As part of our mission to bring out more free music and free culture, we decided to take part in the bid for **[Sunderland City of Culture 2021](http://www.sunderland2021.com/)**. So, tomorrow I will be attending the **[launch event](https://www.facebook.com/events/869898273079694/877166982352823/)**, where I will display what White Market is all about, which naturally includes our long-standing collaboration with Free Music Archive.

In a way, this is a kick-off mix so that people can see White Market’s work on spreading the message on free accessible music. With rock, pop, folk, hip-hop and electronic music in the mix, my main goal was to give an overview of how varied and well-produced free music can be. In the future, I do hope to upload more songs from artists around the Sunderland area.
