Another Friday, another upload to Free Music Archive. This week, we visit the neon lights and shiny beats of [Taseh](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Taseh/)‘s [Dekotora](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Taseh/Dekotora/). Released back in December 2012 by [Monster Jinx](http://www.monsterjinx.com/), the album is a cool mixture of edgy electronic music with fresh glitch influences. Even though it includes some sounds for the most lovey-dovey, it’s more like one for the adventurous souls out there.
