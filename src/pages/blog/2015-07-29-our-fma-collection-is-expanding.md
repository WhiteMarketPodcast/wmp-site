On our [last session](/blog/2015-07-19-session-2-04-keeping-the-engine-running/), I challenged myself to make a new upload to **[White Market’s music collection Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/curator/programamarcabranca/)** every week. It would have been amazing if it wasn’t for the fact that I just moved houses and I am out of internet until August 5th, which makes things just slightly tougher. However, I will try to make up for it and upload some sweet sweet things in a near-ish future.

Now, a few things that you need to know about this **Free Music Archive** thing. I started curating/uploading content for it a few years ago, when White Market was still “**[Programa Marca Branca](http://programamarcabranca.blogspot.pt/)**“- basically the same show, but in Portuguese, airing in 5 different radio stations in Portugal and Spain. When PMB transformed into White Market, I adjusted the descriptions, links and whatnot, while keeping the previously uploaded records online.

The music I upload **is not** a White Market exclusive. You will be able to find it available for download in other places of the Internet and that is basically why I can upload it: because everything is published under a **[Creative Commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/about)**. While the usage permissions change according to the licence chosen by the artist, **they all allow sharing**. With this in mind, my role here is strictly the curator’s one: I search, select and upload songs that are not yet available on FMA, making your search for good free music just a tiny bit easier.

Enough of the chit-chat now. Today, there’s a new record there: **[DarkSunn](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Darksunn)**‘s **[MELANGE](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Darksunn/Melange/)** can now be freely streamed and downloaded on FMA. This is not your average beats album. It is an intricate exercise of mind over matter, in which sounds offers us a deeper perspective on emotional landscapes. I hope you like it; I sure do.
