“**White Market in Context**” is a series of texts with reflections and explanations about **White Market Podcast**. Each text will offer a different approach to WMP’s work, in an attempt to deliver some deeper insights into the project, its production processes and its reach. As this is still part of [my academic project](/blog/2016-07-06-white-market-becomes-syndication-platform/), expect quotes and references, and probably some more elaborate writing. However, I would like to state very clearly that these texts are not supposed to be full academic essays. Instead, they should be seen as support material to White Market Podcast’s work as a whole.
