Coming straight from Rio de Janeiro, [Boss Bass](http://www.bossbass.com.br/) has been bringing love, beats and bass music to the world for quite a long time now. Heavily influenced by genres such as dub, dubstep, bass music and drum & bass, he has published works on [Noudrags Records](https://www.facebook.com/noudragsrecords) and [Psicotropicodelia](http://www.psicotropicodelia.com/); both dedicated to electronic music and two of the most exciting Brazilian netlabels.

“Love For Everyone Everywhere” was released in 2011 and it quickly became one of my favourite CC records. It is released under an [Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence.

Guess what? “[Love For Everyone Everywhere](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Boss_Bass/Love_For_Everyone_Everywhere/)” is now part of [our collection on FMA](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/programamarcabranca/), so you can download it even more easily. This is a fresh record, with heavy bass and a sublime mixture of samba, bossa-nova and drum’n’bass, which wikipedia calls [Sambass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambass) (or Drum ‘n’ Bossa), which is a one of the most prominent drum’n’bass variants in Brazil. If you’re into fat bass lines and drops in your music, this is one for you to grab.
