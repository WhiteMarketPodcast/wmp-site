It’s been a rough month at White Market Podcast’s HQ. As I prepare to move back to Portugal, I have been confronted with a few drawbacks producing the show. Hopefully, this will change soon enough, and the real good news is that there will be some exciting things happening on the show in the near future. _Well, my laptop charger just died on the way here, so maybe I wrote this a bit too early?_

The first thing that you will notice on the next episode is our long-term collaboration with [**Starfrosch**](https://starfrosch.com/hot-100/) in the form of a weekly feature on the podcast. _**Starfrosch Hot Track of The Week**_ is a weekly highlight of a track I particularly like from their Hot100 chart for that week. This feature will already appear on this week’s episode, which should be online tomorrow (fingers crossed!).

As I am writing this post already in Brussels, next Sunday’s session will be dedicated to the **[European Commons Assembly](https://europeancommonsassembly.eu/)** that is taking place this week at the European Parliament. I am still not sure about how the show will come together since there is so much to cover, but if there’s anything in particular that you’d like to see covered, tweet me [@WhiteMarketCast](https://twitter.com/WhiteMarketCast).

As a final note, I’d like to show my tremendous appreciation for all the help and feedback I got from the free music community while working on the show as [my final radio project](/blog/2016-07-06-white-market-becomes-syndication-platform/) for my Master of Arts in Radio Production and Management at the University of Sunderland. I can now reveal that I graduated with a distinction. I will be sharing my final evaluation of the project on the blog soon. Thank you for all your help.
