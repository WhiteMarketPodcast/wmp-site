I had the great honour and pleasure to talk to **[Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/en/)** and find out a bit more how you can help **[#fixcopyright](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fixcopyright&src=typd)**. Julia Reda is a **Member of the European Parliament**, having the only seat owned by the [Pirate Party](http://europeanpirateparty.eu/). She is also a Vice-President of the Greens/EFA group. Since last year, she has been actively fighting for a copyright reform within the European Union – basically trying to make things more uniform and simpler to understand across the various EU territories. She has looked into the various copyright legislations and [compiled a list of things](https://juliareda.eu/copyright-evaluation-report-explained/) that are confusing, contradictory and need an update that is in line with a society that has internet as a focal point and mean of communication. After that, Julia Reda designed a proposal that has now gone under some changes and is [still under discussion](https://juliareda.eu/copyright-evaluation-report/full/). During the interview, we talked about some of her main goals, what she accomplished so far and how people can get involved in this quest.
